# How To Run
Load index.html file and game will initialize.

# How to Play
Use the arrow keys to navigate and make your way to the water!

The player will always load in the bottom grassy area. If the player reaches the water, they win and are reset to the grassy area.
If the player gets hit by a bug, they are reset to the bottom grassy area.

# Background
This was a project that was part of udacity's nanodegree. You are only provided the game assets and basic canvas. All logic, including collisions, locomotion, state management was implemented by myself.

# Tech Stack
- Javascript ES6
- HTML5
- CSS

# Learning Outcomes
- Object oriented javascript through class definitions
- subclassing and abstraction in javascript
- canvas 2D as a method of rendering sprites easily
- writing code for "strict mode"
